Hello there people! This is a repo intended to help you make Pull Requests. 

# What do I do here?
Easy! Fork the repo, and use GitHub traditional editor to add your profile to ``readme.md`` file in the format ``[USER_NAME_HERE](https://github.com/USER_NAME_NERE)``
Once you have done that, come back to this repo, make a pull request and choose the link that says merge with a fork. 
Select your new repo under ``head fork`` and leave ``base fork`` as it is. And you are done!

# Profiles Made
